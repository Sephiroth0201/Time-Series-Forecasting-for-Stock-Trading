# Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Stock-Trading
Project Overview:
The project is designed to provide students with a hands-on opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills gained throughout the course to real-world stock market data. In this project, we will choose a specific stock or portfolio and use various forecasting models to predict future stock prices. The main objective is to compare the performance of different forecasting models, including traditional time series analysis methods (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) and Machine Learning methods(vanilla LSTM,TBATS) in predicting stock market trends. 

Data Collection: 
We will be using historical stock data that is publicly available on Yahoo Finance.

Key Learning Objectives:
1. Gain in-depth understanding of time series data and its characteristics.
2. Explore classical time series forecasting models such as SARIMA and Prophet.
3. Implement advanced time series forecasting models, including Vanilla LSTM.
5. Learn to combine forecasts from multiple models and algorithms to make more robust predictions.
6. Develop and evaluate trading strategies that use time series forecasts for stock trading.

Week 1: Introduction to Time Series Data and Data Preparation
-Basics Introduction to statistics and probability. 
- Introduction to the fundamentals of time series data, its unique characteristics, and the challenges associated with it.
- Learn to collect, preprocess, and clean historical stock price time series data.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques are employed to gain insights into the data.

Week 2&3: Basic Time Series Forecasting Models and Machine Learning Models 
- Introduction to Machine learning and Time series Forecasting Models 
- Delve into classical time series forecasting methods, including ARIMA, and implement these models on historical stock data.
- They compare the performance of different models and understand the strengths and limitations of each.

Week 4: Combining Algorithms and Building a Stock Trading Strategy
- Students explore the idea of combining forecasts from different models and algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy.
- They apply the knowledge gained throughout the project to develop a new comprehensive stock trading strategy, incorporating both time series forecasts and machine learning techniques.

Week 5: 
-Buffer week 

Final Deliverables:
- Code submissions of each model implemented .
- A comprehensive final project report outlining the methodology, results, and key insights.
- Final report should contain your own trading strategy and comparison of the previous models that you implemented  
- Organizing reports and codes in a GitHub repository
